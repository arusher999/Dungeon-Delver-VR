        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to develop an immersive VR dungeon-exploration game in Roblox Creator Studio.
            The game should offer an engaging experience by incorporating dynamic combat mechanics, puzzle-solving elements,
            and an interactive environment. The primary objective is to leverage VR functionalities in Roblox to create
            an innovative and interactive dungeon crawler that enhances user engagement and immersion.

        <h2>Research & Background</h2>
        <p>
            Our initial research focused on understanding the unique aspects of developing VR experiences within Roblox Creator Studio.
            Since Roblox VR capabilities are still evolving, much of our investigation centered on current community practices,
            official documentation, and examples of VR integration in other games. This approach helped us identify best practices
            and potential pitfalls when designing an immersive environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Roblox VR Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>VR Support Overview:</strong>
                <br>
                Roblox has ongoing support for VR devices, including the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, but many advanced interactions
                (e.g., hand tracking, custom VR controls) require custom scripting.
                <br>
                <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/VR-Support" target="_blank" class="button-link small">
                    Official Roblox VR Support Documentation
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Movement & Interaction:</strong>
                <br>
                Roblox VR typically provides default movement controls, but customized locomotion and interaction systems can be
                scripted for a deeper sense of immersion (teleportation, climbing, grabbing objects, etc.).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Roblox Studio Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Scripting & Development:</strong>
                <br>
                To leverage VR in Roblox, developers need a strong understanding of Lua scripting within the Roblox Studio environment.
                <br>

                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Building & Asset Creation:</strong>
                <br>
                Dungeon Delver VR relies on custom-built assets, lighting, and environment design. Efficient use of Roblox Studio’s
                terrain tools and object management is essential for performance, especially in VR.

        </ul>

        <h3>Existing VR Dungeon Games & Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
            Beyond Roblox, we explored successful VR dungeon crawler games for design inspiration—focusing on what makes
            these experiences compelling, such as interactive environments, responsive combat systems, and a clear progression path.
            We found that combining well-known dungeon-crawling tropes (loot, monsters, hidden paths) with VR immersion
            (hands-on interactions, real-time dodging and attacking) can create a truly engaging adventure.
        </p>

        <h3>User Experience in VR</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motion Control:</strong> Teleportation vs. smooth locomotion to reduce motion sickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Immersive Feedback:</strong> Using haptic feedback and spatial audio for enhanced realism.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Ensuring stable frame rates to minimize VR discomfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Custom Scripting:</strong>
                Roblox VR integration often requires bespoke scripts for advanced interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Haptic & Spatial Audio:</strong>
                Greatly enhances immersion and player satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Replayability:</strong>
                Procedural dungeon generation can keep the game fresh and replayable.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI Integration Plan</h2>
        <p>
            While AI integration is not the primary focus of this project, there are potential uses for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NPC Behavior & Enemy AI:</strong> Implementing pathfinding (e.g., A*) and decision-making for enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Procedural Dungeon Generation:</strong> Using AI-based techniques to randomize dungeon layouts and maintain replayability.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Difficulty:</strong> Dynamically adjusting enemy strength and puzzle complexity to match player performance.</li>
        </ul>
