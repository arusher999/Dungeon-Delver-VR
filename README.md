## Week 4 Submission

### Task 1: Mentor Fit & Guidance
The ideal mentor for this project would have experience in game development, especially in Roblox Creator Studio, and knowledge of AI for enemy behavior and dungeon generation. Project management skills would help with planning, and expertise in VR mechanics would be useful for optimizing gameplay. A mentor who can review code and provide technical guidance would be a great fit.

Key questions for a mentor would focus on their experience with VR and AI in gaming, their approach to balancing gameplay and technical challenges, and best practices for organizing a development pipeline. It would also be helpful to ask about common pitfalls, performance optimization, and recommended resources for learning and staying updated on VR technology.

### Task 2: Resource Gathering & Organization

Resources are currently stored on our Resources Document which can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqkEOb5JbafPxMEBeonPbCNRnoFX96NN3Usl3Z5It-U/edit?usp=sharing

Hamiz is currently working to integrate the roblox coding environment to Github.

## Week 3 Submission

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop an immersive VR dungeon-exploration game in Roblox Creator Studio. The game should offer an engaging experience by incorporating dynamic combat mechanics, puzzle-solving elements, and an interactive environment. The primary objective is to leverage VR functionalities in Roblox to create an innovative and interactive dungeon crawler that enhances user engagement and immersion.

A Dungeon Delver video game in Roblox VR has not been created yet. Popular dungeon video games like Diablo and The Binding of Isaac have been made but never in a virtual reality format.

### Research & Background

To understand the feasibility and best practices for developing VR experiences in Roblox, initial research focused on:

Roblox Creator Studio’s VR Capabilities: Analyzing the available tools and APIs for VR integration.

Existing VR Dungeon Games: Exploring game mechanics, player engagement strategies, and interactive elements in popular VR dungeon crawlers.

User Experience in VR: Investigating best practices for motion control, immersive feedback, and reducing motion sickness in VR environments.

### Key Findings:

VR support in Roblox is still evolving, requiring custom scripts for interaction and locomotion.

Haptic feedback and spatial sound significantly enhance immersion.

Procedural dungeon generation can improve replayability and engagement.

### End-of-Day 1 Checkpoint:

Finalized problem statement.

Documented key research insights.

### Week 3 – Day 2: AI Integration & Preliminary Task Listing

AI Integration Plan

While AI integration is not a primary focus for the VR implementation, potential AI applications include:

NPC Behavior & Enemy AI: Implementing pathfinding (e.g., A* algorithm) and decision-making for enemies.

Procedural Dungeon Generation: Using AI-based techniques to create randomized dungeons.

Adaptive Difficulty: Adjusting enemy strength and puzzle complexity based on player performance.

Preliminary Task List

Environment Design: Build the dungeon structure and interactive elements.

VR Mechanics Implementation: Develop locomotion, hand interactions, and combat mechanics.

AI Integration: Implement basic NPC behaviors and procedural level generation.

UI & Player Experience: Create HUD elements, tutorial sections, and in-game prompts.

Testing & Iteration: Playtest and refine movement, interactions, and performance.

### End-of-Day 2 Checkpoint:

Defined AI integration plan.

Drafted a preliminary task list.

### Week 3 – Day 3: Refine Task List, Timeline, & GitHub Setup

Refined Task List & Timeline

Environment Design - 1-2 weeks
VR Mechanics Implementation - 2 weeks

Environment Design/ AI Integration - 1.5 weeks

Basic gameplay setup/UI & Player Experience - 1 week

Core mechanics done/Testing & Iteration - Ongoing

All features implemented and GitHub Repository Setup - 1-2 remaining weeks

### End-of-Day 3 Checkpoint:

Task list and timeline finalized.

GitHub repository structured and initialized.

Week 3 – Day 4: Final Review, Reflection & Next Steps

Final Review

All components (Problem Statement, AI Plan, Task List, Timeline, GitHub Setup) have been documented and refined. The primary focus now is implementation and iteration.

Reflection & Next Steps

What do you still need to accomplish or clarify?

- Refine AI behaviors and procedural generation models.

- Optimize VR controls and locomotion for smooth gameplay.

What resources do you need?

- Advanced Roblox VR scripting tutorials.

- AI implementation resources (pathfinding, procedural generation).

What challenges or uncertainties are you facing?

- Potential performance issues with real-time dungeon generation.

- Maintaining player comfort in VR (motion sickness mitigation).

How do you plan to address these challenges?

- Conduct iterative testing with small-scale environments before expanding.

- Implement comfort options (e.g., teleportation movement, vignette effects).
