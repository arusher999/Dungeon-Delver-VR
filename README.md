## Week 3 Submission

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop an immersive VR dungeon-exploration game in Roblox Creator Studio. The game should offer an engaging experience by incorporating dynamic combat mechanics, puzzle-solving elements, and an interactive environment. The primary objective is to leverage VR functionalities in Roblox to create an innovative and interactive dungeon crawler that enhances user engagement and immersion.

A Dungeon Delver video game in Roblox VR has not been created yet. Popular dungeon video games like Diablo and The Binding of Isaac have been made but never in a virtual reality format.

#Research & Background

To understand the feasibility and best practices for developing VR experiences in Roblox, initial research focused on:

Roblox Creator Studio’s VR Capabilities: Analyzing the available tools and APIs for VR integration.

Existing VR Dungeon Games: Exploring game mechanics, player engagement strategies, and interactive elements in popular VR dungeon crawlers.

User Experience in VR: Investigating best practices for motion control, immersive feedback, and reducing motion sickness in VR environments.

# Key Findings:

VR support in Roblox is still evolving, requiring custom scripts for interaction and locomotion.

Haptic feedback and spatial sound significantly enhance immersion.

Procedural dungeon generation can improve replayability and engagement.

# End-of-Day 1 Checkpoint:

Finalized problem statement.

Documented key research insights.

# Week 3 – Day 2: AI Integration & Preliminary Task Listing

AI Integration Plan

While AI integration is not a primary focus for the VR implementation, potential AI applications include:

NPC Behavior & Enemy AI: Implementing pathfinding (e.g., A* algorithm) and decision-making for enemies.

Procedural Dungeon Generation: Using AI-based techniques to create randomized dungeons.

Adaptive Difficulty: Adjusting enemy strength and puzzle complexity based on player performance.

Preliminary Task List

Environment Design: Build the dungeon structure and interactive elements.

VR Mechanics Implementation: Develop locomotion, hand interactions, and combat mechanics.

AI Integration: Implement basic NPC behaviors and procedural level generation.

UI & Player Experience: Create HUD elements, tutorial sections, and in-game prompts.

Testing & Iteration: Playtest and refine movement, interactions, and performance.

# End-of-Day 2 Checkpoint:

Defined AI integration plan.

Drafted a preliminary task list.

# Week 3 – Day 3: Refine Task List, Timeline, & GitHub Setup

Refined Task List & Timeline

Environment Design - 1-2 weeks
VR Mechanics Implementation - 2 weeks

Environment Design/ AI Integration - 1.5 weeks

Basic gameplay setup/UI & Player Experience - 1 week

Core mechanics done/Testing & Iteration - Ongoing

All features implemented and GitHub Repository Setup - 1-2 remaining weeks

# End-of-Day 3 Checkpoint:

Task list and timeline finalized.

GitHub repository structured and initialized.

Week 3 – Day 4: Final Review, Reflection & Next Steps

Final Review

All components (Problem Statement, AI Plan, Task List, Timeline, GitHub Setup) have been documented and refined. The primary focus now is implementation and iteration.

Reflection & Next Steps

What do you still need to accomplish or clarify?

- Refine AI behaviors and procedural generation models.

- Optimize VR controls and locomotion for smooth gameplay.

What resources do you need?

- Advanced Roblox VR scripting tutorials.

- AI implementation resources (pathfinding, procedural generation).

What challenges or uncertainties are you facing?

- Potential performance issues with real-time dungeon generation.

- Maintaining player comfort in VR (motion sickness mitigation).

How do you plan to address these challenges?

- Conduct iterative testing with small-scale environments before expanding.

- Implement comfort options (e.g., teleportation movement, vignette effects).
